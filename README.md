Initially I planned on making a Sneaker site using a sneakers api where the users can look up and keep track of all the shoes past, current, and future. I changed plans because I didn't have time to figure out how to work a downloaded api.

My next plans were to have the same set up as I did for the sneakers but replace it with super heroes and villians. I wanted the users to be able to search characters, add them to a personal list and make comments about them. The api I found worked but I realized the way to wanted to search information wasn't an option for how they implemented it and I didn't have time to find a way around it so that's when I tried to simplify my project a little more to myBasic Docs
